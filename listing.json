BC Laws is hosted by the Queen’s Printer of British Columbia and published in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and the Law Clerk of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nBC Laws contains a comprehensive collection of BC legislation and related materials. It is available on the internet in two forms:\r\nFirst: The library is available as a web site in which users can browse and search the laws of British Columbia.\r\nSecond: The library is available as a portal to legislation in raw XML data format, accessible via the BC Laws API.\r\n\r\n This direct access to raw data is intended to enable third parties to build or add their own custom applications based on the structure of the data and all the associated search functionality inherent in that structure. The BC Laws website itself is an example of one such application of the BC Laws API.\r\n...\r\nThe BC Laws API is available according to the [Queen's Printer License – British Columbia] (http://www.bclaws.ca/standards/2014/QP-License_1.0.html).",
