# BCLaws-API-Management
BCDevExchange has been investigating the use of an API Management Tool (currently WSO2) to help provide various functions for managing APIs. This project involves using BCLaws as a pathfinder to illustrate how the API Management tool would be integrated with other BCDevExchange components.

This repo contains minimal information about the process of getting this done (the 'project'), but has been created to help illustrate how repos in GitHub can be flagged with certain tags (see bottom of readme.md) to be returned by a BCDevExchange.org function.
